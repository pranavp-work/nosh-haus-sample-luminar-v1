                    <h3>⭐⭐⭐⭐</h3>
                    <p>Nosh is truly a hidden gem that more people need to discover. It’s a peaceful, relaxed spot with country music playing softly in the background—perfect for unwinding. The food is refreshingly different, embracing classic Western-style dishes instead of blending into Indian cuisine. The strong, flavorful coffees have unique names I’m still learning, and the sandwiches are simply perfection. I had a multigrain double cheese sandwich with wild blueberry filling—it was crunchy yet soft, sweet but balanced, and absolutely mouthwatering. It’s a 10/10 experience. Nosh deserves more attention, and I highly recommend giving it a try!</p>

                    <h3>⭐⭐⭐</h3>
                    <p>This is my second favourite cafe in Kochi.
                        Would love to go there any day any time.
                        It's a bummer that they don't have enough of parking, but good enough for one car if lucky. Enough parking for bikes though.I would be prepared to ignore that for the quality of Cafe
                        My all time fav:- Dark Roasted French press edition - French roast 100% Arabica</p>

                    <h3>⭐⭐⭐⭐</h3>
                    <p>Recommended Foods -(the ones I have tried)
                        - Almost all forms of Coffee
                        -Alfredo chicken Pasta
                        -Peanut butter shake
                        -Affagato with chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla
                        - Burgers
                        - Pizza
                        
                        Not Recommended (rather the ones I didn't like)
                        
                        -Chicken salami sandwich with Sourdough bread
                        - "Almost breakfast" - the potato wedges was cold and soggy (didn't even heat it), pickles felt out of place. Eggs, beans and pepperoni were ok</p>
